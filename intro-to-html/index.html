  	<h1>HTML is Awesome!</h1>
    <p>I am learning how to code. It is a little <strong>scary</strong> at first, but I know with time and hard work, it will get <em>easier.</em> I will keep going every day so I can make the <strong>best</strong> life for my family. So far, I like <a href ="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started/ "title ="Introduction to HTML">learning HTML</a>  and am excited to learn more! Someday, I will be an <em>excellent</em> programmer, until then, I study hard and live vicariously through my favorite show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(TV_series)#/media/File:Silicon_valley_title.png" title="Silicon Valley Intro"> Silicon Valley.</a></p>
