    <p>Finley is a curious, spirited, and astonishingly handsome boy. At just 4 years old, he has already changed the lives of everyone who knows him. His favorite activities include toy-shopping with his Mimi, getting silly and snuggled with Mom, and having epic action-figure battles with his Dad. Finley loves his cat Pepper, and is always happy to make a new friend.</p>
    <p>A boy of excellent taste, Finley prefers to dine on his favorite foods of spaghetti or pizza. However, he avoids broccoli and most other vegetables like the plague. Due to the hardships of toddlerhood, the occasional tantrum is thrown and time-outs are enforced, but that doesn't get this dude down. Finley is a good hearted little man who is learning all about the world and his place in it. He truly is a "Wonder-Boy!"</p>
